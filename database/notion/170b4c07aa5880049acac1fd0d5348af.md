I did this through the ICT Academic Credit Partnership Program. 'Your Butler' was a B2C company providing house cleaning services. While working there as a front-end development intern, I realized two important things. First, I gained confidence through the experience of working as a developer in a real company. Second, I discovered that I enjoyed the service planning and conceptualization phase more than development. This experience ultimately led me to decide to pursue graduate studies in HCI.
