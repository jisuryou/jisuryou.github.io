### Project Summary

**Project Name:** Development of Growth Database-based Voice Agent

**Service Name:** "Dream Station"

**Service Purpose:** Provide a service that allows users to easily record dream content immediately after waking up, with the ability to later search and replay by date or keyword

**Project Process:** Ideation → Conversation design → Voice agent development → User interviews

**Contribution:** Led entire project as PM

---

### Background

**Problem Definition:**

- When exploring use cases for data exchange, most devices already support storing objective information
- However, considering the usage environment of voice services (personal and private spaces), there is a need to explore new use cases that can handle private and intimate information

**Goal Setting:**

- Explore new possibilities for voice services using dreams as a personal and interesting subject matter
- Design a system that allows users to easily record dreams and provides additional value through data storage, analysis, and search capabilities

---

### Key Roles and Contributions

**(1) Project Management and Ideation**

**Purpose:** Discover innovative use cases reflecting the characteristics and user environment of voice services

**Contributions:**

- Enhanced recording necessity and service utility by choosing 'dreams' as a subject matter that users experience daily but easily forget
- Clearly defined the personalized value of the service while emphasizing the psychological appeal of dream recording

**(2) Conversation Design and Technical Implementation**

**Purpose:** Develop conversation flows and technical solutions considering the limitations of voice services and long-form dream data

**Contributions:**

- Led voice interface design and development using Google Dialogflow
- Attempted conversation design solutions to address gaps and timeout issues during dream recording
- Implemented emotion analysis and keyword extraction features using Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Utilized Google Sheets as a database for simple and efficient data storage and management

**(3) User Interviews**

**Purpose:** Deeply understand users' dream recording experience and derive service improvement directions

**Contributions:**

- Analyzed service experience through interviews with 11 users over 2 weeks
- Confirmed that the enjoyment of dream recording and the voice agent's role as a listener led to positive user responses
- Generated improvement ideas to complement the awkwardness of voice recognition and mechanical responses

### Project Outcomes

**Achievements:**

- Successfully received deployment approval on the Actions on Google platform, but service is no longer available due to sunset of Conversational Actions ([Documentation Link](https://sites.google.com/view/snuxlabdreamstation/home))
- Conference Submission :: CHI 2023 ["You Said Da Da…": A Short Echoing Tweak for Journaling with VA] (1st Author) ([Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585901))

**Insights:**

- Confirmed that appropriate voice agent feedback can overcome system limitations (timeout) and be utilized as a recording tool
- Potential to enhance personalized feedback and recommendation features using recorded dream data
