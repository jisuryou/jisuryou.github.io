# Jisu Ryou’s Portfolio

I have mainly focused on developing conversational AI in my projects. I explored innovative use cases and designed smooth conversational experiences; such as ‘*Trend Bot*’—a trend sharing chatbot, ‘*Banky*’—a banking voice agent, ‘*Dream Station*’—a dream recording voice agent and ‘*Mind Bots*’—voice agents imitating human mind in purpose of exhibition. In leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), I developed '*CEtty*'—a voice-activated diary agent that uses GPT-generated questions to guide entries. I also created *an automated system for chatbot evaluation*, which employs prompts to simulate the human assessment process.

Additionally, I have actively engaged as a researcher, designer, and developer across diverse domains, cultivating my expertise in engineering overall UX throughout all stages of a project. For example, I have experience deriving insights through UX research in *shopping, home appliance, and financial* domains. I've also participated in developing mobile apps and websites as UX design deliverables.
