### Summary

**Project Name:** Naver Shopping UX Improvement - Behavior Type Modeling Based on Log Data

**Project Purpose:** Analyze user behavior patterns based on Naver Shopping's log data and develop UX improvements to provide optimal shopping experiences

**Project Process:** Shopping sequence analysis → Clustering → User interviews

**Contribution:** Participated as a researcher in shopping sequence analysis and user interviews

---

### Background

**Problem Definition:**

- While Naver Shopping users exhibit various behavior patterns (searching for lowest prices, browsing products, purchasing specific items, etc.), they experience the same interface and functionality

**Goal Setting:**

- Develop UX improvements for optimal shopping experiences based on log data for each behavior type

---

### Key Roles and Contributions

**(1) Shopping Sequence Analysis**

**Purpose:** Define user behavior patterns by analyzing Naver Shopping's page structure and UI patterns

**Contributions:**

- Defined 26 page groups for all pages on the Naver Shopping platform based on page structure and UI patterns
- Designed shopping model by deriving exploration-transaction-revisit sequences between page groups from log data

**(2) User Interviews**

**Purpose:** Gain deep understanding of user behavior context and complement data-driven analysis

**Contributions:**

- Observed user behavior for 15 recent purchases using think-aloud technique and reenactment tasks
- Conducted in-depth questions and interviews based on recorded utterances and behavioral data during shopping tasks
- Organized interview results by behavior type and compared with clustering results

---

### Project Outcomes

**Achievements:**

- Proposed continuous UX analysis framework by developing UX improvements for each behavior type
- Conference submission :: HCI Korea 2023 [Actually, Clustering is Not Everything! How UXer analyzes behavior types with page log data] (2nd author) ([Paper Link](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11229699))

**Insights:**

- Realized that raw log data alone is insufficient for fully understanding user behavior context
- Learned the importance of multi-faceted approaches in UX research through the process of deriving behavior types by combining data and user interviews
