### Graduation Thesis

- (Best Paper) Study on a VA Journaling System: Focusing on Response Styles for Receiving Long Entries in VA Journaling
- My thesis research involved creating a journaling system using a voice assistant. I hypothesized that people might share more when speaking their journal entries, especially if someone was listening and responding.
- The research was conducted in two parts. In the first part, I developed a voice assistant that could respond in three different ways: (1) Responding with empathy (2) Brief repetition of user's statements (3) Combining both approaches
- The research findings were interesting. People preferred when the AI simply repeated their words rather than giving complex responses. However, this simple repetition had its drawbacks. People tended to state only facts without expressing emotions, as they didn't have enough time to deeply reflect on their feelings. The study also revealed that people typically follow two journaling patterns: one focused on recording events, and another on expressing emotions.
- In the second study, we improved upon these issues. We used GPT to not only repeat what users said but also ask questions about their experiences and emotions. We believed this would provide appropriate support based on each person's journaling style. Indeed, this new system received better user feedback and resulted in longer journal entries.
