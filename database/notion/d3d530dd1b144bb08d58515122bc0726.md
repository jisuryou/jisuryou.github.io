### Project Summary

**Project Name:** Exploring Financial Chatbot Evolution through Voice Banking

**Service Name:** *"Banky"*

**Service Purpose:** Implementation of key financial services (primary account linking, balance and account book checking, money transfers and budget setting, etc.) through voice commands, transforming traditional screen-based banking apps

**Project Process:** Voice Data Collection (DTS) → Prototype Development → Prototype Testing (DTA) → User Interviews

**Contribution:** Participated as a researcher in user interviews and insight derivation

---

### Background

**Problem Definition:**

- While financial institutions are steadily implementing chatbots, usage rates and recognition remain insufficient
- Moving beyond traditional scenario-based or tree-structured chatbots, a new approach is possible through voice interaction, the ultimate form of conversation

**Goal Setting:**

- Analyze key user needs by collecting voice interaction data in real financial environments

---

### **Key Roles and Contributions**

**(1) DTA (Digital Trigger Agent) Research**

**Purpose:** Analyze practical financial voicebot needs through user utterance data from prototype voicebot

**Contributions:**

- Conducted speech elicitation experiments with 10 subjects using 2 vlog videos and 10 finance-related scenes
- Recorded unique user utterances during experiments and conducted semi-structured interviews after completion
- Secured 477 user utterance data points through DTA experiments

**(2) Insight Development**

**Purpose:** Understand the context of utterance data and analyze detailed information about user needs

**Contributions:**

- Conducted in-depth investigation of user needs for financial chatbots through post-experiment semi-structured interviews
- Through data analysis, summarized the development direction of financial chatbots as "casual banking that allows comfortable conversation, knows me well through data, handles complex tasks efficiently, and can chat about all aspects of my life"
